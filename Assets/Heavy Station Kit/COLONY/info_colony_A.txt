MODELING
The new look for many objects. Flat surfaces got less tris. Round ones like the railings got more. To widen the possibilities new objects were added.

MAPPING
To reduce the drawcalls, most models were packet into themes. Each theme is a single Material.
Some UVs has a bit of free space. This is reserved for future updates, so adding new objects will not require additional material.

TEXTURING
All the materials now has Metallic, Height and Occlusion maps, in addition to Albedo, Normal, and if it fits, Emission.

– Fixed compability issue with Sci-Fi Heavy Station Kit base and hangars.
